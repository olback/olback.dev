          Since a lot of players in CS:GO hack, I decided to take that to an advantage. Today I made the site <a href="cheats">Cheats</a>. <br>
          How the troll works: <br>
          I ask for $10 and their email. When i recive the donation i reply with a message where I<br>explain how to install the "hack". The thing is...<br>
          It's not a "hack" it's just a .BAT file that looks like a hack. All the file does is it shows some text and deletes system32.<br>

          So today i added the downloads tab and a page with usefull links. <br> You can check out the page with usefull links <a href="links" target="_blank">here</a> <br>
          The links page is primarily used in the in-game steam browser. <br>Since you cant add bookmarks i decided to make a page that would make my life a bit easier :) <br>

          Got most of the CSS things done by now. I'll put more energy on the actual site now. <br>
          Oh and btw, I use the European date format. <code>YYYY-MM-DD</code> <br>
          <code>2015-10-09</code>
